# GNU-PhotoShop

> A lite weight Photo editing Program (currently CLI only) written in python3 for day to day photo editing.
> Disclaimer : Currently we don't want to compete with any profesional level program like GIMP or Any Other.
> Instead we want to make a software that will ease photo editing for a user with almost no experience to photo editing.
